   - Estimated Timeline: 1-2 weeks
   - Notes: Depends on specific features desired, but generally involves extending TextEditor functionality

4. **Sort by functionality**
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Estimated Timeline: 3-5 days
   - Notes: Requires implementing sorting logic and modifying the tab order

5. **Custom file class with chapters (like OneNote)**
   - Difficulty: Hard
   - Estimated Timeline: 2-3 weeks
   - Notes: Involves creating a new data structure and significantly modifying the UI

6. **Embedding model for retrieval augmented generation**
   - Difficulty: Hard
   - Estimated Timeline: 3-4 weeks
   - Notes: Requires integration with machine learning models and potentially setting up a backend

7. **Setting up AI connections**
   - Difficulty: Medium to Hard
   - Estimated Timeline: 2-3 weeks
   - Notes: Depends on the specific AI services to be integrated

8. **Setting up tool use for AIs based on Aliases**
   - Difficulty: Hard
   - Estimated Timeline: 3-4 weeks
   - Notes: Requires designing a system for alias recognition and tool execution

9. **Voice to text functionality**
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Estimated Timeline: 1-2 weeks
   - Notes: Can be implemented using existing libraries, but may require fine-tuning for accuracy

10. **Knowledge graph creation**
    - Difficulty: Very Hard
    - Estimated Timeline: 4-6 weeks
    - Notes: Involves complex natural language processing and data structuring

11. **Knowledge graph display and navigation**
    - Difficulty: Hard
    - Estimated Timeline: 3-4 weeks
    - Notes: Requires implementing a graph visualization system within the PyQt6 framework

12. **Updated UI features**
    - Difficulty: Medium
